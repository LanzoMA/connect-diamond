# Connect Diamond (or Four in a Diamond)

![Connect Diamond Banner](connect-diamond.png)

* It's like four in a row except you must make a diamond pattern with 4 of your own counters. 
* There are two players on a 7 wide and 6 high grid.
* The aim is to get your counters in a diamond pattern like this:

```
    R

R   Y   R
    
Y   R   Y
```

* In this scenario, red would win.


# Prerequisites

* gcc
* make

# Build Instructions

* Enter these commands one by one into your shell to build it:
